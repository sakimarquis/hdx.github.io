I am broadly interested in understanding the representations that any biological and artificial agents used to perform cognitive tasks. Most of my research time, I build phenomenological models to identify the hidden variables in behaviors, and build optimization-based neural network models to find normative neural solutions for cognitive functions. I also utilize methods from experimental psychology, computational neuroscience, machine learning, deep learning, statistics, physics, and computer science.

The questions I am currently working on:

- Neural mechanism of flexibly encoding prior in working memory.  
- Exploration strategies across different species.
- How do agents trade-off the complexity and generality to form task representations flexibly?
- How to learn a map (physical or cognitive) without a metric representation.
- How much intelligence comes from language?



# About me

I'm a psychology PhD student at the University of Arizona. I am in the Cognitive Neural System Program working with Robert Wilson and Arne Ekstrom. Prior to my PhD, I worked with Xue-Xin Wei at UT Austin, and Da-Hui Wang at Beijing Normal University. Before that, I used EEG to study working memory. Before that, I studied counseling psychology with a focus on cognitive behavioral therapy.



Some interesting facts:

- I enjoyed reading when I was young. My favorite writers are James Joyce, Milan Kundera, Jorge Borges, Franz Kafka , Dostoyevsky and Edgar Allan Poe. 
- This stupid username was set when I was a teenager, came from [Saki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saki) and [MÃ¡rquez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_M%C3%A1rquez).
- Yet I didn't read much after high school. Suddenly lose my patience with long books. 
- I am addicted to computer games, but only when there is an exam approaching. Since there are few exams I should take, I seldom play them now. 
- I enjoy skiing, sick jokes, embarrassing short videos and sarcasm. 
- Using a second language is painful for me, mostly because I can't help being sarcastic but I can't do it well in English. 
- I am bad at calculating. I often mess up with single digit calculations, even with pen and paper. This always makes me doubt myself as a researcher in computational neuroscience.
- The pronunciation of my name is "HWAH-doang SHAWNG".

I am broadly interested in understanding the representations that any biological and artificial agents used to perform cognitive tasks. Most of my research time, I build phenomenological models to identify the hidden variables in behaviors, and build optimization-based neural network models to find normative neural solutions for cognitive functions. I also utilize methods from experimental psychology, computational neuroscience, machine learning, deep learning, statistics, physics, and computer science.

The question I am working on:

- Neural mechanism of flexibly encoding prior in working memory.  
- Exploration strategies across different species.
- How do agents trade-off the complexity and generality to form task representations flexibly?
- Can agents learn a map (physical or cognitive) without metric representation? 
- How much intelligence comes from language?

# about me

I'm a psychology PhD student at the University of Arizona. I am in Cognitive Neural System Program working with Robert Wilson and Arne Ekstrom. Prior to my PhD, I worked with Xue-Xin Wei at UT Austin, and Da-Hui Wang at Beijing Normal University. Before that, I used EEG to study working memory. Before that, I studied counseling psychology with a focus on cognitive behavioral therapy.

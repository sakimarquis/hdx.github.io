I use models to understand behaviors of both biological and artificial agents and explore how computation could be implemented in neural networks. Following the release of GPT-4, my research interest has partially shifted towards understanding the emergence of intelligence within large language models. 

My current research interests include:

- Use recurrent neural network as cognitive model to identify the hidden variables in decision-making across species.
- Examine the ways prior information could be encoded in working memory system through optimization-based neural network models.
- Investigate how humans utilize language as a tool of control and agency through dialogue. 

# About me

I am a PhD student in the Cognition and Neural Systems Program at the University of Arizona. I work with [Robert Wilson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4LxikSIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Prior to my PhD, I worked with [Xue-Xin Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7Pd1QzwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at UT Austin, and [Da-Hui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6BkFUZcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) at Beijing Normal University. Before that, I used EEG to study working memory. Before that, I studied counseling psychology with a focus on cognitive behavioral therapy.

The pronunciation of my name is "HWAH-doang SHAWNG".

Some interesting facts:

- I enjoyed reading when I was young. My favorite writers are James Joyce, Milan Kundera, Jorge Borges, Franz Kafka , Dostoyevsky and Edgar Allan Poe. 
- This stupid username was set when I was a teenager, came from [Saki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saki) and [MÃ¡rquez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_M%C3%A1rquez).
- Yet I didn't read much after high school. Suddenly lose my patience with long books. 
- I am addicted to computer games, but only when there is an exam approaching. Since there are few exams I should take, I seldom play them now. 
- I enjoy skiing, sick jokes and embarrassing short videos. 
- Using a second language is painful for me, mostly because I can't help being sarcastic but I can't do it well in English. 
- I am bad at calculating. I often mess up with single digit calculations, even with a pen and paper. This always makes me doubt myself as a researcher in computational neuroscience.  (But large language models also fail to do simple calculations, I am not alone)
